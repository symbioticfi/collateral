## Symbiotic

**Symbiotic is a shared security protocol enabling decentralized networks to control and customize their own multi-asset restaking implementation.**

Symbiotic core consists of:

- **Collateral**: a new type of asset that allows stakeholders to hold onto their funds and earn yield from them without needing to lock these funds in direct manner or convert them to another type of asset.

- **Vaults**: the delegation and restaking management layer of Symbiotic that handles three crucial parts of the Symbiotic economy: accounting, delegation strategies, and reward distribution.

- **Operators**: entities running infrastructure for decentralized networks within and outside of the Symbiotic ecosystem.

- **Resolvers**: contracts or entities that are able to veto slashing incidents forwarded from networks and can be shared across networks.

- **Networks**: any protocols that require a decentralized infrastructure network to deliver a service in the crypto economy, e.g. enabling developers to launch decentralized applications by taking care of validating and ordering transactions, providing off-chain data to applications in the crypto economy, or providing users with guarantees about cross-network interactions, etc.
